# spanish-morpheme

Parses Spanish words based on their endings. I use two main functions to do this: simple_add_slashes and infinitive_break. The former looks for all words with a certain  ending and then makes a slash right before that ending. It keeps in mind exceptions and cases, exceptions where it is everything except an array, while cases only adjusts the words in the array. For infinitive_break, looks at the beginning of the word and sees if it has the same stem as one of the words in the array you give it. From there, it will create a split depending on how many characters you want it to remove. For verbs, I gave a large list of verbs in their infinitive along with stem changers with the infinitive (i.e v#ner from venir). For other parts of speech, I used this with only one character, turning words like uno into un/o. The goal of this code is to be able to train a computational model on this to find out how infants relate different words to each other in different forms.
